                    <p> The Lebanon Crisis Analytics Team Data Analysis Hub is a groundbreaking platform that provides
                        critical insights into the economic situation in Lebanon. Our team led the comprehensive,
                        multifaceted full-stack project that spanned eight months in the initial push and has had two
                        additional task orders, building a chained machine learning
                        model to forecast exchange rates and prices for essential items such as food, fuel, and consumer
                        price indices.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We also designed and implemented custom visualizations to analyze the model's
                        performance, generate price forecasts, project pass-through rates, and map the Economic
                        Vulnerability Index. Furthermore, we implemented web analytics tracking using Google Analytics
                        and Google Tag Manager to enable greater understanding of user behavior within the application.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We are proud to have played, and continue to play a large role, the development of this
                        platform, which provides
                        essential insights into the economic challenges facing Lebanon and informs critical
                        decision-making for international aid organizations.

                    <p> Built to support Mercy Corps' strategic imperatives related to regional food insecurity in the
                        Horn of Africa, the Horn of Africa Livestock Hub showcases interactive data visualizations for
                        environmental factors, livestock production, trade, and rangeland health. It also features a
                        Livestock System Dynamics Model that helps to understand the impact of various factors,
                        including environmental and social, on food security in the region.

                        <br>
                        The model allows fordata-driven insights into the livestock system dynamics, providing
                        decision-makers with
                        information to better manage food systems in the region. Argot Nova provided end-to-end services
                        for this project, including building data pipelines, full-stack development, and hosting the
                        application. Overall, this project showcases the potential impact of technology and data
                        analysis in planning for sustainable and resilient food systems as well as highlights the
                        importance of data-driven solutions in addressing complex societal challenges, such as food
                        insecurity.

                         all of which can be viewed at various levels of granularity, from the national to the
                          local level. This dashboard's public affiliation is restricted due to 
                        regional sensitivities about predictive analytics in Yemen.<br>
                        <br>
                        The platform features custom food price forecast models which were built by
                        Argot Nova using model chaining. Additionally, to enable analytics post launch,
                         Argot Nova integrated Google Analytics to collect and monitor user behavior, 
                         including most-visited pages, scrolling, clicking, and selecting.
